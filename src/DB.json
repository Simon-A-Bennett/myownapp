    "Hubble Space Telescope hunts for a black hole among a brilliant field of stars",
  "body": "The Hubble Space Telescope has captured a stunning image of a distant cluster of stars that could help us better understand how such collections evolve and potentially even reveal the elusive black holes at their hearts. Globular clusters like the one in this Hubble Space Telescope image, known as NGC 6325, can contain between tens of thousands to millions of stars and are found across all types of galaxies. The Milky Way itself is home to around 180 known globular clusters. Because all the stars in a globular cluster are believed to have formed at the same time from the same collapsing cloud of gas and dust, studying them can teach astrophysicists a great deal about how stars form and evolve. But astronomers are looking for something else in NGC 6325 much more elusive than its densely packed stars: A compact cosmic titan called an intermediate-mass black hole. The search for specimens of this class is an important one, as astronomers still don't quite know how they are are born."
